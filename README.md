## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to:

- Implement a responsive navigation bar with a toggle feature:

```js
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
  const navbarToggler = document.querySelector(".navbar-toggle");
  const navbarCollapse = document.querySelector(".navbar-collapse");
  const navbarIcon = document.querySelector(".navopen");

  navbarToggler.addEventListener("click", function () {
    if (!navbarCollapse.classList.contains("collapse")) {
      navbarIcon.src = "assets/images/icon-menu-close.svg";
      navbarCollapse.classList.add("collapse");
      document.querySelector("body").style.overflow = "hidden";
    } else {
      navbarIcon.src = "assets/images/icon-menu.svg";
      navbarCollapse.classList.remove("collapse");
      document.querySelector("body").style.overflow = "visible";
    }
  });
});
```
